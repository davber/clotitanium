clotitanium
===========

An abstraction of the Titanium mobile platform in ClojureScript.


# Installation

In order to use this abstraction, you need to:

* include the `cljs-macros` directory in your ClojureScript path for macros, and
* include the `cljs` directory in your ClojureScript source path.

Using Leiningen and the `cljsbuild` plugin, you add this:


# Get Started

To get started with a new project, just copy the `samples/skeleton` directory and change generic settings to suite your application.


# Titanium

Titanium expects to see an `Resources/app.js` so as long as you generate
the JavaScript code there from the Clojure code, you are fine. This is what is done in the dummy Leiningen project.
